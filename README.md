# vagrant-puppet-enterprise

This Vagrantfile will setup a Multi-VM vagrant environment based on Puppet Enterprise with a Puppet Master and one or more Puppet Agents. Using this setup, you can develop and test Puppet modules that have more than trivial functionality (e.g. exported resources, etc).

Note: Puppet Enterprise is free to use up to 10 nodes. If you use more than 10 nodes, please [buy the appropriate licences](https://puppetlabs.com/puppet/how-to-buy/).

## Setup

Specifications:
* Centos 6.4 x86_64 minimal
* Puppet Enterprise 2.8.0
* Put manifests in: `manifests/` folder
* Put modules in: `modules/` folder
* Puppet dashboard: https://192.168.111.111 (login: puppet@example.com / puppet@example.com)

Requirements:
* VirtualBox 4.2
* Vagrant 1.1

The setup is based on multi-machine vagrant setup; there is 1 puppet master, and 1 or more agents. Both types have their own basebox:
* [Master](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/23470422/vagrant-pe/vagrant-centos-64-x86_64-pe-master.box)
* [Agent](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/23470422/vagrant-pe/vagrant-centos-64-x86_64-pe-agent.box)

The puppet master has a fixed IP address: 192.168.111.111. You can add as many agents as you like, but be sure to give them a unique IP address in the 192.168.111.x range (.1 and .111 are taken). To do so, duplicate the agent block in the `Vagrantfile` and `site.pp` files.

Use the Vagrantfile and site.pp templates below and replace the following fields:
* `<manifests_local_path>` - Local path for the puppet manifests. Must contain the site.pp file (see template below).
* `<modules_local_path>` - Local path for the puppet modules. Will probably point to a local git repository
* `<agent_name>` - Name for the agent. Used within Vagrant (e.g. `vagrant provision agent_name`)
* `<agent_hostname>` - Hostname for the agent. This links vagrant with puppet. Must be unique within this Vagrantfile.
* `<agent_ipaddress>` - IP adress for the agent. Must be unique within all running VirtualBox images.

### site.pp template

	# Make filebucket 'main' the default backup location for all File resources:
	filebucket { 'main':
	  server => 'puppet',
	  path => false,
	}
	File { backup => 'main' }

	node default {}

	node '<agent_hostname>' {
	  ... resource declarations ...
	}

## Caveats

When destroying and recreating an agent while keeping the puppet master image, you will get a certificate error:

	err: Could not request certificate: The certificate retrieved from the master does not match the agent's private key.

This is because the agent will generate a new certificate when the box is recreated. The old certificate is still known with the puppet master. Two options:
* Destroy and recreate the master as well
* Revoke the old agent certificate on the puppet master and remove the certificate from the agent:

	vagrant ssh master -c 'sudo puppet cert clean <agent_hostname>'
	vagrant ssh agent -c 'sudo rm /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/ssl/certs/<agent_hostname>.pem'
